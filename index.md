## About Me


![Profile Picture](assets/images/Mae.jpg){: .profile-image}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am entering my fourth year as a Mechanical Engineering student. I am passionate about human-centered design in engineering, as well as soft robotics and biomechanics. I am currently studying to pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam, as I hope to obtain a professional engineering license in the future. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
