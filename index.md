My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am entering my fourth year as a Mechanical Engineering student. I am passionate about human-centered design in engineering, as well as soft robotics and biomechanics. I am currently studying to pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam and seek an engineering disipline to work under a Professional Engineer as an Engineer in Training.
