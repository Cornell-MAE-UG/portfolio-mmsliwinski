For my engineering project team Cornell Assistive Technologies, we recieved from a local family in Ithaca to adapt a typical pen holder design to be controlled by a thumbscrew. Previously, the design only accomodated a screwdriver design which makes it impossible for people with motor disabilities to change the pen without assistance. This design utalizes a thumbscrew which promotes ease of access and independence of the user.
