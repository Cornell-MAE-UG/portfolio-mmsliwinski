#### Activities
- **Cornell Assistive Technologies Student Project Team - Engineering Team Lead** 
  [ December 2022 - Present]
  -	Developing 3D printed assistive technology solutions designed with Fusion360 and OpenSCAD
  - Running a team of 15+ tasked with adapting childrenâ€™s toys to be more user friendly by adding new circuitry and designing custom printed circuit boards in Fusion360
  - Facilitating community outreach by working with over 10 organizations and partners in New York State to develop 4+ high impact assistive technology solutions
  - Raised $400 to contribute to a total crowdfunding total of $2,450 that Cornell Engineering will help match to fund future accessibility projects

  - **Organic Robotics Lab - Research Assistant**
    [November 2023 - Present]
    - Working with a PhD student in Dr. Robert Shepherd's lab designing and assembling combustion acutators for a sustainable fuel-use digging robot in SolidWorks
    - Creating a custom multi-channel fuel intake organizer with Fusion360 to prevent leakage with a luer lock mechanism and manufacturing with a Figure 4 resin printer
    - Analyzing displacement data of the combustion actuators with different fuel ratios with high-speed camera capture to characterize the actuators. Characterized the membrane properties using Finite Element Analysis simulation in ANSYS to predict displacement.
